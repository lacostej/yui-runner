X move the example as an integration-test with maven so that failing the junit tests because the expectation and doesn't fail the build
X change the API so that a Test is mapped to a URL not a File (see change-api-use-URLs branch)
X support HtmlUnit in default example
* add more unit tests
* use proper logging - find a way to collect console logs as well !
* consider rewriting the collector code in Java to remove the dependence upon scala ? might be better for reuse. For tests we still consider a dependency on scala acceptable
* allow people to disable / enable listeners on the collector and on the runner
* show how to run multi browser tests
* verify if surefire-reports saving integration works as expected
* make code multi-threaded (reports collector)
* fix reporting
