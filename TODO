* use proper logging
* consider rewriting the collector code in Java to remove the dependence upon scala ? might be better for reuse. For tests we still consider a dependency on scala acceptable
* change the API so that a Test is mapped to a URL not a File
* allow people to disable / enable listeners on the collector and on the runner
* show how to run multi browser tests
* support HtmlUnit in default example
* verify if surefire-reports saving integration works as expected
* make code multi-threaded (reports collector)
* fix reporting
