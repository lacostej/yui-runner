A YUI runner for JUnit.

Infrastructure for running browser specific tests using selenium in a deployed browser. Can also be used to easily debug server side tests from your editor.

See the yui-runner-example project for a complete setup.

YUITests infrastructure
* a YUI2Test class uses a special JUnit runner
  The class sets the environment up by itself (starts and stops jetty).
  The runner will use selenium (webdriver) and load all single HTML pages.
  Those pages are self-testable, meaning that they will trigger the running of the test suite and report the results back to the application
* the test runner retrieves the collected reports and manages them properly


Some limitations
* the code is written in Scala. Might be better to rewrite it in Java to ease adoption by other projects
* the API could probably be improved.
* one might want to use a different paradigm (i.e. non self tested HTML pages) for running the tests
* note aggregation of the saved YUI reports under target/surefire-reports by hudson is untested... FIXME

Some advantages
* self-contained
* works the same from your editor (eclipse, Intellij) or maven or hudson
* should benefit from the surefire reporting capabilities in maven (and hudson)
